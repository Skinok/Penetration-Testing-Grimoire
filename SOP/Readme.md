# Standard Operating Procedures
A SOP, or Standard Operating Procedures list, is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out complex routine operations. The following sections should be used as checklists to ensure that the penetration test is as thorough as possible for your client. It is recommended to follow the [Penetration Testing Execution Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) as closely as possible. You can also create your own SOP unique to your Red Team which includes documents, procedures documentation, and even checklist software.
