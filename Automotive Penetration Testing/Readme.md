# Automotive Penetration Testing
Automotive Penetration Testing tests the following,
* Effectiveness of security controls designed by automobile manufacturers;
* Attack Surface (risk);
* Replay Attacks;
* Physical Access; and
* Reverse Engineering.

Most of these exercises in this field deal with vulnerability analysis and risk analysis. Automobiles are built with more and more interconnected features for user convenience each year. For each convenience poses a possibility for penetration testing and vulnerabilities.
