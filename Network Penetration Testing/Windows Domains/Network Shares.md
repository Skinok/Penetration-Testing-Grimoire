# Small Message Block
Small Message Block is the protocol used by Microsoft domains for Windows-based networks. 
## Scanning for Low-Hanging Fruit
We can use `Metasploit` with the auxiliary module, `smb_ms17_010`, to scan for hosts who are vulnerable to the EternalBlue remote exploit:

*Uses information disclosure to determine if MS17-010 has been patched or not. Specifically, it connects to the IPC$ tree and attempts a transaction on FID 0. If the status returned is "STATUS_INSUFF_SERVER_RESOURCES", the machine does not have the MS17-010 patch. If the machine is missing the MS17-010 patch, the module will check for an existing DoublePulsar (ring 0 shellcode/malware) infection. This module does not require valid SMB credentials in default server configurations. It can log on as the user "\" and connect to IPC$.*
## Scanning for SMB
We can use multiple tools to scan for SMB shares as listed in the subsections below.
### SMBTree
Use SMBTree without authentication,
```
smbtree -n
```
### NMAP
We can use the `nmap` tool to do SMB share discovery with a command like so,
```
nmap -p 445,139 -Pn --open -vv -oA smb_shares_10.0.0.0-255 -sC -sV 10.0.0.0/24 
```
### CrackMapExec
We can use CrackMapExec to scan for network shares using credentials or no credentials.
#### Unauthenticated
```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.0/24 
```
#### Authenticated
```
crackmapexec smb -u username -p password 10.10.10.0/24
```
## Connecting to Network Shares
We can use the same tools listed above to make connections to the SMB shares and list the contents.
### SMBClient

### SMBMap

### CrackMapExec
