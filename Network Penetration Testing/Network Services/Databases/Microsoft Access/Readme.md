# Reading MDB Files in LINUX
Install and use the `gmdb2` GUI-based application as so,
```
root@wnl8:~# apt -y install mdbtools-gmdb
root@wnl8:~# gmdb2
```
This will start a GUI application. Click `Open` and browse to the MDB file that you obtained from the target server. GMDB2 will analyze the file and display the tables. Click on a table and click the `Data` button the right side of the pane and a new window will open displaying the data in an Excel-like format.
